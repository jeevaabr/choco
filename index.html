		<p>Active youngsters who can't get enough of the sports and athletics offered in 
		after-school programs during the year can spend their summer vacation blowing off 
		steam in the coolest ways possible. Kids' fitness centres in the city and beyond 
		offer endless sports camps for kids, from a brand-new sports program,inspired 
		acrobatics camp or swimming lessons. With awesome youth fitness classes and camps 
		available for almost any sport you can imagine, you'll have no problem getting 
		little ones off the couch.</p>

		<p>If you’ve been to camp, you’re not surprised to hear about the benefits of 
		summer camp. Experiencing life at camp yourself as a child, you know the profound 
		positive effects that still matter to you as an adult, and you also know that you
		 want the same thing for your own kids. But if you didn’t go to camp as a child,
		  you may not realize just how good the experience is for children. You may not
		   know why so many parents are committed to sending their kids to camp.
		Camp is an independent experience that shapes one’s character and life a controlled,
		 safe environment where children and youth are able to make their own decisions about
		  simple things (what activity they want to do, how many more they want make, or what
		   clothes they are going to wear) and about important things (who they will hang out
  		  with who will be their friends).</p>
 	   <p>Our Summer Camp is currently open to children of ages 7-16 and features all 
    	of the regular camp activities like Basketball Camp, Baseball Camp, Physical 
   		 Training, Band Camp, Swimming camp and Nature Discovery-with a seasonal twist. Outdoor
    	 activities take place throughout our 57-acre site, and our spacious lodge and
    	  cabins will accommodate indoor activities and rainy day schedules. Because we
       are aware of the fact that those rainy days do happen during the winter break, 
       our capacity is smaller than it is during the summer months.</p>
